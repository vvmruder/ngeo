Querent is a service that issues all sorts of queries using\n   * ngeo data sources. It does not store the result. Instead, it returns it\n   * using promises. Any component that inject this service can use it to\n   * make it issue its own queries and do whatever it wants with the result.\n   *\n   * It supports sending OGC requests and parse the response, such as:\n   * - WFS DescribeFeatureType\n   * - WFS GetFeature\n   * - WMS GetCapabilites\n   * - WMS GetFeatureInfo\n   * - WMTS GetCapabilities\n   *\n   * @struct\n   * @param {angular.$http} $http Angular $http service.\n   * @param {angular.$q} $q The Angular $q service.\n   * @param {!ngeo.filter.RuleHelper} ngeoRuleHelper Ngeo rule helper service.\n   * @param {!ngeo.misc.WMSTime} ngeoWMSTime wms time service.\n   * @ngdoc service\n   * @ngname ngeoQuerent\n   * @ngInject\n   */\n  constructor($http, $q, ngeoRuleHelper, ngeoWMSTime) {\n\n    // === Injected properties ===\n\n    /**\n     * @type {angular.$http}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.http_ = $http;\n\n    /**\n     * @type {angular.$q}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.q_ = $q;\n\n    /**\n     * @type {!ngeo.filter.RuleHelper}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.ngeoRuleHelper_ = ngeoRuleHelper;\n\n    /**\n     * @type {!ngeo.misc.WMSTime}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.ngeoWMSTime_ = ngeoWMSTime;\n\n\n    // === Other properties ===\n\n    /**\n     * Promises that can be resolved to cancel started requests.\n     * @type {!Array.<angular.$q.Deferred>}\n     * @private\n     */\n    this.requestCancelers_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Cache of promises for WMS GetCapabilities requests.
